# Jitsi Meet for YunoHost

## Disclaimer
**Jitsi** for YunoHost for now as some limitations:
  * Can only be used using Chrome/Chromium
  * Is limited to two participants

Those limitations come from the packaging of the upstream app. Have to be improved.

## Overview
Jitsi Meet is a libre software (Apache) WebRTC JavaScript app that uses Jitsi Videobridge to provide high quality, secure, and scalable video conferences.

**Shipped version:** 1.0.4127

## Important points before installing

1. **Jitsi** requires a dedicated **root domain**, eg. jitsi.domain.tld
2. **Jitsi** requires the ports TCP/4443 and UDP/10000 to be forwarded to your YunoHost (The same way you forwarded 80 (HTTP), 443 (HTTPS), etc... https://yunohost.org/#/isp_box_config)
